He was always willing to dive deep into the details of whatever project he was on, even if he didn't initially have the domain knowledge yet. He has a great sense of ownership, while also able to be very humble in receiving feedback.",

			'Kartheek is an incredibly talented engineer I had the honor of working with. His attention to detail made it a breeze to build products with. As a designer I knew any ideas I had, Kartheek would welcome, excited by the challenge to build what ever I presented. A great engineer also cherishes the user experience and I can say Kartheek is one of those. Great products are built together, and Kartheek pushed the designs as much as I pushed the development. Without him, the Landing products would not be what they are today. It would be an honor to work with him again.',
